This is a "Stock Market Game" based on a mini-project from Harvard University's CS50 and CS50x course.  It has been modified from the original specifications for use by High School economics courses to teach students about the stock market.

Upon account creation, users (students) will be given 10,000 in virtual currency with which to trade stocks.  They can look up stock prices, buy stocks, and sell stocks.  The goal, of course, will be to make as much money as possible in an allotted time.

In the future, other features may be added (for example, the ability to borrow money from a bank).
